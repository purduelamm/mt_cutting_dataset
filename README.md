### Purpose
The primary aim of sharing this dataset is to promote transparency and repdoducibility in research. By making this dataset publicly available, we hope to:

* Enable other researchers to validate and build upon our findings.
* Foster collaboration and data sharing withint the research community.
* Contribute to the body of knowledge in the field of machine sound recognition of metal cutting industry.

### Description
There are two datasets, `IMI` and `KRPM`.
