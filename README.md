# CNC Machine Tool Cutting Sound Dataset

## Introduction
Welcome to the CNC milling cutting sound dataset repository. This dataset has been collected as part of the research conducted for the papers[^1], [^2] . The dataset encompasses cutting sound in CNC milling process in both lab and industry settings, which have been meticulously collected and processed to facilitate reproducibility and further research.

### Purpose
The primary aim of sharing this dataset is to promote transparency and repdoducibility in research. By making this dataset publicly available, we hope to:

* Enable other researchers to validate and build upon our findings.
* Foster collaboration and data sharing within the research community.
* Contribute to the body of knowledge in the field of machine sound recognition of metal cutting industry.

### Description
There are two datasets, `IMI` and `KRPM`.
